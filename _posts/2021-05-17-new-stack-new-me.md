## Picking a stack to experiment with

It's a classic situation, I've been working on a stack for work for while but my eye has been drawn to something new. I don't really know if these new technologies are better, or they just have a nice looking landing page.

It's time to explore a new stack, the only way to do that it is to build something. (Ideally something small)

| **Function** 	|**Tech**  			|  **Why**			|
|---			|---				|---				|
|  Styling	|  Styled Components		|  Nice n Modular			|
|  Front End	|  Next.js 			|  SEO Friendly 			|
|  Back End 	|  Node Typescript 	|  Keep it JS, less mess with TS 			|
|  Database 	|  Mongo DB 	|  This could be airtable for ease of use, but I'd prefer less lock-in 			|
|  Arcitecture 	|  Terraform - AWS 	|  Not as set on this one, I know I'll look at AWS but I'd rather stay out of that dashboard if possible 			|

## Prototype plan
1. Write business case
2. Map out tools and technology 
3. Create rough wireframes of the UI
4. Sketch out Arcitecture
5. Define API Structure
6. Define AWS resources needed
7. Write Epics & Stories
8. Build
9. Launch
10. I'm tempted to write "profit" here but that's not my play from the out.

## Other Ideas

Having an API be consumed by a web app and a react native app is something that I've thought about a lot. 

Maybe it will be a stretch too far (and 2 front ends to maintain afterwards) but I'll put it as a maybe for now. It should also keep me disciplined in keeping my front ends dumb.
