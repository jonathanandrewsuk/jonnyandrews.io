## Picking a stack to experiment with

It's a classic situation, I've been working on a stack for work for while but my eye has been drawn to something new. I don't really know if these new technologies are better, or they just have a nice looking landing page.

It's time to explore a new stack, the only way to do that it is to build something. (Ideally something small)

| **Function** 	|**Tech**  			|  **Why**			|

|  Front End	|  Next.js 			|  cool 			|
|  Back End 	|  Node Typescript 	|  cool 			|
|  Arcitecture 	|  Terraform - AWS 	|  cool 			|
